# Scoping tests

I start with defining the `title` and `callback` arguments on the `test()` function. Those will represent the _test's title_ and the _test itself_, respectively. Next, I invoke the `callback()` function, which will run whichever test we provide. Since failed assertions throw errors, I wrap the `callback()` in a `try/catch` block to prevent the process from exiting on failed assertions and also to print those nicely in the terminal's output.

<CodeFile file="greet.js" range="27-35" highlight="28,31" />

Then, I wrap our existing tests in the `test()` function, giving it a meaningful title so the expectation behind each test is clear.

<CodeFile file="greet.js" range="9-15" highlight="9,13" />

Now, whenever a test fails, we can immediately see its title and the relevant assertion error below.

```sh nonumber
node greet.js
```

```txt nocopy lines=1-3
✗ returns a greeting message for the given name
Error: Expected Hello, ${name}! to equal to Hello, John!

✓ returns a congratulation message for the given name
```
