# Assertions

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/testing-fundamentals/test-structure/imperative-vs-declarative-assertions" />

Okay, let's apply that test structure to our test for the `greet` function.

## Test structure

First, let's take a look at what test phases we already have.

### Setup

We don't have any special setup to test the `greet` function. The setup phase is optional and you will often find it missing in unit tests (testing isolated pieces of code like we have over here).

### Action

Our action for this test is to call the `greet` function with the `'John'` string as the argument.

```ts filename=greet.ts nocopy nonumber
let message = greet('John')
```

### Assertion

And our assertion is a simple `if` statement that compares the actual `message` with the message we expect to be returned (`'Hello, John!'`).

```ts filename=greet.ts nocopy nonumber
if (message !== 'Hello, John!') {
	throw new Error(
		`Expected message to equal to "Hello, John!" but got "${message}"`,
	)
}
```

## The problem

Our assertion has two problems.

First, it's _imperative_. We instruct the code _how_ to do things instead of declaring _what_ we want to do.

Second, it's _repetitive_. This may not be as evident right now, but consider what happens if we have to test a new function called `congratulate`:

```js filename=greet.ts lines=11-15,18-22 nocopy
function greet(name) {
	return `Hello, ${name}!`
}

function congratulate(name) {
	return `Congrats, ${name}!`
}

let message = greet('John')

if (message !== 'Hello, John!') {
	throw new Error(
		`Expected message to equal to "Hello, John!" but got "${message}"`,
	)
}

message = congratulate('Sarah')
if (message !== 'Congrats, Sarah!') {
	throw new Error(
		`Expected message to equal to "Congrats, Sarah!" but got "${message}"`,
	)
}
```

It would be great to abstract that logic into a declarative function called `expect`. With that function, these two tests would look like this:

```js lines=9-10
function greet(name) {
	return `Hello, ${name}!`
}

function congratulate(name) {
	return `Congrats, ${name}!`
}

expect(greet('John')).toBe('Hello, John!')
expect(congratulate('Sarah')).toBe('Congrats, Sarah!')
```

<callout-info>
	Preferring declarative APIs when testing often leads to more readable and
	manageable tests.

üë®‚Äçüíº Your task right now is to implement this `expect` function and refactor the existing tests to use it. Feel free to use this outline for reference:

```js
function expect(actual) {
	return {
		toBe(expected) {
			// Compare the actual to the expected
			// and throw if they don't match.
		},
	}
}
```
