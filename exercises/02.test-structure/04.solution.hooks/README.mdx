# Hooks

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/testing-fundamentals/test-structure/handle-test-side-effects/solution" />

First, I add the `beforeAll()` and `afterAll()` function declarations to the `global` namespace in TypeScript:

<CodeFile file="setup.ts" range="1-10" highlight="8-9" />

Then, I implement the `beforeAll()` function, which invokes the given `callback` immediately.

<CodeFile file="setup.ts" range="32-34" highlight="33" />

<callout-warning>Here, I'm relying that the `beforeAll()` function will be called _before_ any individual tests. Actual testing frameworks usually have a runner responsible for internally orchestrating hooks and tests regardless of the invocation order.</callout-warning>

The `afterAll` function will be a bit different. To invoke the `callback` once the tests are done, I will utilize the `beforeExit` event of a Node.js process to let me know when the test run is about to exit.

<CodeFile file="setup.ts" range="36-40" highlight="37-39" />

Then, I go to the `greet.test.ts` and add the `beforeAll()` hook that patches the global `Date` constructor and uses the stored `OriginalDate` class to create a fixed date.

<CodeFile file="greet.test.ts" range="3-9" highlight="3,6-8" />

Similarly, I make sure to clean up this `Date` mock in the `afterAll()` hook:

<CodeFile file="greet.test.ts" range="11-13" highlight="12" />

<callout-success>Remember the rule of clean hooks: have a cleanup for each side effect in your setup (e.g. spawn a server → close the server; patch a global → restore the global).</callout-success>
