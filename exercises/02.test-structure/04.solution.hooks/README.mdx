# Hooks

First, I add the `beforeAll()` and `afterAll()` function declarations to the `global` namespace in TypeScript:

```ts filename=setup.ts highlight=8-9 nonumber
interface Assertions {
	toBe(expected: unknown): void
}

declare global {
	var expect: (actual: unknown) => Assertions
	var test: (title: string, callback: () => void) => void
	var beforeAll: (callback: () => void) => void
	var afterAll: (callback: () => void) => void
}
```

Then, I implement the `beforeAll()` function, which invokes the given `callback` immediately.

```ts filename=setup.ts highlight=2 nonumber
globalThis.beforeAll = function (callback) {
	callback()
}
```

<callout-warning>Here, I'm relying on the fact that the `beforeAll()` function will be called _before_ any individual tests. Actual testing frameworks usually have a runner responsible for internally orchestrating hooks and tests regardless of the invocation order.</callout-warning>

The `afterAll` function will be a bit different. To invoke the `callback` once the tests are done, I will utilize the `beforeExit` event of a Node.js process to let me know when the test run is about to exit.

```ts filename=setup.ts highlight=2-4 nonumber
globalThis.afterAll = function (callback) {
	process.on('beforeExit', () => {
		callback()
	})
}
```

Then, I go to the `greet.test.ts` and add the `beforeAll()` hook that patches the global `Date` constructor and uses the stored `OriginalDate` class to create a fixed date.

```ts filename=greet.test.ts highlight=1,4-6 nonumber
const OriginalDate = globalThis.Date

beforeAll(() => {
	globalThis.Date = new Proxy(globalThis.Date, {
		construct: () => new OriginalDate('2024-01-01'),
	})
})
```

<callout-warning>I recommend providing an entire UTC date, including an explicit timezone, as the value of the mocked date to have a resilient test setup: `new OriginalDate('2024-01-01 00:00:00.000Z')`</callout-warning>

Similarly, I make sure to clean up this `Date` mock in the `afterAll()` hook:

```ts filename=greet.test.ts highlight=2 nonumber
afterAll(() => {
	globalThis.Date = OriginalDate
})
```

<callout-success>Remember the rule of clean hooks: have a cleanup for each side effect in your setup (e.g. spawn a server → close the server; patch a global → restore the global).</callout-success>
