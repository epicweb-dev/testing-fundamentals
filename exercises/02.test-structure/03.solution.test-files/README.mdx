# Test files

I start by creating a new `greet.test.ts` file and moving only the `test(...)` blocks there.

<CodeFile file="greet.test.ts" range="3-9" />

<callout-info>Which suffix to use: `.spec.ts` or `.test.ts`, or both?</callout-info>

If I try to run test test file now, it will exit on undefined `greet()` and `congratulation()` functions because they are neither defined nor imported from anywhere.

So I go and export those functions from the `greet.ts` module:

<CodeFile file="greet.ts" range="1-7" highlight="1,5" />

And import them in the test file:

<CodeFile file="greet.test.ts" range="1-9" highlight="1" />

Next, I want to make the `test()` and `expect()` functions available _globally_. Every test will be using those, so there's no need to explicitly import them every time.

Next, I create a `setup.ts` file where I start by describing the `test()` and `expect()` functions in TypeScript. I add them to the `global` namespace to let TypeScript know those functions will be available globally, and that we don't have to import them.

<CodeFile file="setup.ts" range="1-8" highlight="5-8" />

Then, I move the existing `test()` and `expect()` functions directly to the `globalThis` object to expose them globally on _runtime_ and also benefit from the type inferrence since they are now fully annotated!

<CodeFile file="setup.ts" range="10-29" highlight="10,20" />

All that remains is to verify that the tests are running correctly.

```sh nonumber
npx tsx --import ./setup.ts greet.test.ts
```

> I am using the `--import` option in Node.js to load the `setup.ts` module _before_ running `greet.test.ts`. This makes the `test()` and `expect()` functions globally available in the test's _runtime_.
