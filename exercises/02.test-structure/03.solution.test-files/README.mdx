# Test Files

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/testing-fundamentals/test-structure/move-tests-into-modules/solution" />

I start by creating a new `greet.test.ts` file and moving only the `test(...)` blocks there.

```ts filename=greet.test.ts nonumber
test('returns a greeting message for the given name', () => {
	expect(greet('John')).toBe('Hello, John!')
})

test('returns a congratulation message for the given name', () => {
	expect(congratulate('Sarah')).toBe('Congrats, Sarah!')
})
```

<callout-info>Which suffix to use: `.spec.ts` or `.test.ts`, or both?</callout-info>

If I try to run test test file now, it will exit on undefined `greet()` and `congratulation()` functions because they are neither defined nor imported from anywhere.

So I go and export those functions from the `greet.ts` module:

```ts filename=greet.ts highlight=1,5
export function greet(name: string) {
	return `Hello, ${name}!`
}

export function congratulate(name: string) {
	return `Congrats, ${name}!`
}
```

And import them in the test file:

```ts filename=greet.test.ts add=1
import { greet, congratulate } from './greet.js'
```

Next, I want to make the `test()` and `expect()` functions available _globally_. Every test will be using those, so there's no need to explicitly import them every time.

Next, I create a `setup.ts` file where I start by describing the `test()` and `expect()` functions in TypeScript. I add them to the `global` namespace to let TypeScript know those functions will be available globally, and that we don't have to import them.

```ts filename=setup.ts highlight=5-8 nonumber
interface Assertions {
	toBe(expected: unknown): void
}

declare global {
	var expect: (actual: unknown) => Assertions
	var test: (title: string, callback: () => void) => void
}
```

Then, I move the existing `test()` and `expect()` functions directly to the `globalThis` object to expose them globally on _runtime_ and also benefit from the type inference since they are now fully annotated!

```ts filename=setup.ts highlight=1,11 nonumber
globalThis.expect = function (actual) {
	return {
		toBe(expected: unknown) {
			if (actual !== expected) {
				throw new Error(`Expected ${actual} to equal to ${expected}`)
			}
		},
	}
}

globalThis.test = function (title, callback) {
	try {
		callback()
		console.log(`✓ ${title}`)
	} catch (error) {
		console.error(`✗ ${title}`)
		console.error(error, '\n')
	}
}
```

All that remains is to verify that the tests are running correctly.

```sh nonumber
npx tsx --import ./setup.ts greet.test.ts
```

> I am using the `--import` option in Node.js to load the `setup.ts` module _before_ running `greet.test.ts`. This makes the `test()` and `expect()` functions globally available in the test's _runtime_.
