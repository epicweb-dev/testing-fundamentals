Congratulations! :tada: You've completed the "Testing fundamentals" workshop! It was a great effort and you can certainly be proud of yourself.

You are now equipped with all it takes to approach any test, and with great power comes great responsibility. Remember your lessons and feel free to share them with others! You will be surprised how many people miss the fundamentals you learned today. Those will go a long way, and I can't wait for you to apply this knowledge in your job or pet projects.

There is _a lot_ more to learn about testing, and I hope to see you in the workshops to come!
