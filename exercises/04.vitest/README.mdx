# Moving to Vitest

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/testing-fundamentals/moving-to-vitest/overview-of-vitest" />

Up to this point, we've been building what essentially is a primitive testing framework. Functions like `test()`, and `expect()`, and even `waitFor()` are the building blocks that help us structure and execute our automated tests.

And our testing framework works a lot like [Vitest](https://vitest.dev)!

**Choosing the right testing framework is crucial**. Your tests are only as reliable as your framework. Your tests are only as fast as your framework. This is why we are going to migrate our setup to use Vitest, which is a modern testing solution for JavaScript.

> I personally love Vitest! It offers all the familiar functionality one would expect from a testing framework while working natively with ESM and respecting your test environment. And it's blazingly fast too!
