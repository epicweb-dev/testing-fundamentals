# Using Vitest

Once you have the knack of how testing frameworks work, adopting one should be a walk in the park. It comes down to two steps:

1. Replacing our own helper functions, like `test()` and `expect()`, with those provided by the testing framework;
1. Using the recommended CLI command to run the tests.

In this exercise, let's migrate to Vitest together.

🐨 First, install Vitest by opening your terminal and running this command:

```sh nonumber
npm install vitest --save-dev
```

🐨 Next, <InlineFile file="vitest.config.js">Click here to create the `vitest.config.js` file</InlineFile>

And paste the following config in there:

```js filename=vitest.config.js
import { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config'

export default defineConfig({
	test: {
		globals: true,
	},
})
```

This is a basic Vitest configuration file. We are setting the `test.globals` option to `true` to tell Vitest to expose functions like `test()` and `expect()` globally for every test.

Now, all that's left is to run our existing tests using the `vitest` CLI:

```sh nonumber
npx vitest
```

And see the result:

```sh nonumber nocopy
 ✓ greet.test.js (5)
   ✓ returns a greeting message for the given name
   ✓ returns a greeting message for the given user response
   ✓ throws on greeting user with undefined user response
   ✓ returns a congratulation message for the given name
   ✓ displays a notification when a new user joins
