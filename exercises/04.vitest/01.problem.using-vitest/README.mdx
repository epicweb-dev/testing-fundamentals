# Using Vitest

Once you have the knack of how testing frameworks work, adopting one should be a walk in the park. It comes down to two steps:

1. Replacing our own helper functions, like `test()` and `expect()`, with those provided by the testing framework;
1. Using the recommended CLI command to run the tests.

In this exercise, let's migrate to Vitest together.

üí£ First, let's delete the `setup.ts` file!

Gone. The purpose of that file was to implement our own tiny testing framework but since we are replacing it with Vitest now, it will provide us with the functionalities we had in `setup.ts` out of the box (like the `test()` and `expect()` functions).

üê® Next, install `vitest` by opening your terminal and running this command:

```sh nonumber
npm install vitest --save-dev
```

Next, go to `tsconfig.json` and add `"vitest/globals"` to the `"compilerOptions.types"` key:

```diff
{
  "compilerOptions": {
+    "types": ["vitest/globals"]
  }
}
```

This will tell TypeScript where to look for the type definitions for the global functions like `test()`, `expect()`, and `beforeAll()`.

To complete the global API setup, we also need to expose the _runtime implementation_ for those global functions.

üê® To do so, <InlineFile file="vitest.config.ts">Click here to create the `vitest.config.ts` file</InlineFile>

And paste the following config in there:

```ts filename=vitest.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config'

export default defineConfig({
	test: {
		globals: true,
	},
})
```

This is a basic Vitest configuration file. We are setting the `test.globals` option to `true` to tell Vitest to expose functions like `test()` and `expect()` globally for every test.

Now, all that's left is to run our existing tests using the `vitest` CLI:

```sh nonumber
npx vitest
```

And see the result:

```sh nonumber nocopy
 ‚úì greet.test.js (5)
   ‚úì returns a greeting message for the given name
   ‚úì returns a greeting message for the given user response
   ‚úì throws on greeting user with undefined user response
   ‚úì returns a congratulation message for the given name
   ‚úì displays a notification when a new user joins
