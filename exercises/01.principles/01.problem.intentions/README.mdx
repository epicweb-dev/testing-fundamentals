# Intentions

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/testing-fundamentals/principles/write-an-intentional-test" />

You have a `greet` function that should greet the user by their name. That's the _intention_ behind it. And here's its implementation:

```ts filename=greet.js nocopy nonumber
function greet(name: string) {
	return `Hello, ${name}!`
}
```

👨‍💼 Now your job is to add an automated test for the <code>greet</code> function
(you can put it in the same <code>greet.ts</code> file) so you can run <code>npx tsx
greet.ts</code> any time you want to check whether that functions works as
intended.

As a reminder, this is what any automated test comes down to:

```ts
// Run the code and get the *actual* result.
let result = code(...args)

// Compare the actual with the expected results.
if (result !== expected) {
	// Alert us if the two results don't match
	// as that likely means a bug in the code.
	throw new Error(`Expected "${expected}" but got ${result}`)
}
```

<callout-info>Remember that an automated test is a comparison between the actual and the expected values of the program.</callout-info>
