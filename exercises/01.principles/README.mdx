# Principles

Any code you write has some intention behind it. To listen to a button click, to
handle a response from the server, to apply styles when the user mouses over the
element—there are thousands of things you want your application to do. And you
use code to describe your intention in a language that the computer understands.

**But how do we know that the code works as intended?** How do we catch those
times when it doesn't, and how do we find out why?

## Manual testing

The most straightforward answer is _to use that code_.

For example, if you have a `sum` function that adds any two given numbers, you can call it with some numbers and see what it returns:

```js nonumber lines=2
sum(2, 3)
// 5
```

It seems to return a number. We compare that actual number (`5`) with what we expect to see (`5`) and
conclude that it works correctly. Congratulations, you have just done _manual
testing_! :tada:

You took a piece of code, ran it, and validated the result. That is testing in a
nutshell. The only problem being, you did that testing _in your head_. You have
no tangible proof that the code actually works. It seems to work now but
tomorrow your colleague merges a pull request that changes the code. Would it still work? Well, hopefully, they did some
manual testing before merging...

**"Hoping it works" isn't a reliable testing strategy.** And neither is manual
testing. It may be relatively easy to do for a simple function like `sum` but real-world systems can have countless functions like that. All with
a purpose. All equally important in the grand scheme of things. Manually
checking every single one of those would take forever and, to make things worse,
would be inefficient and prone to errors.

We are humans and we make mistakes. As incredible as our brains are, we cannot
be expected to keep a laser-sharp focus and run thousands of lines of code in
our mind. If only there was something to help us with that kind of
_computing_...

## Automated testing

Let's use computers and _automate_ this whole process!

Conceptually, the steps we have to test the `sum` function remain the same:

1. Pick a code to test (i.e. our `sum` function);
1. Run the code with particular arguments;
1. Check whether the actual result equals to the expected (indended) result.

Here are the same steps (abstractly) represented in JavaScript:

```js
// Run the code and get the *actual* result.
let result = code(...args)

// Compare the actual with the expected results.
if (result !== expected) {
	// Alert us if the two results don't match
	// as that likely means a bug in the code.
	throw new Error(`Expected "${expected}" but got ${result}`)
}
```

In this exercise, you will learn about the intentions, implementations, their relationship and how to automate testing by writing the most basic test.
