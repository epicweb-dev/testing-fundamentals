# Awaiting Promises

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/testing-fundamentals/testing-asynchronous-code/handling-promises-in-tests" />

In our application, we use the `greet()` function a lot in conjunction with fetching the user from a server. To simplify this usage, we've introduced a new function called `greetByResponse()` that accepts a Fetch API `Response` instance representing the user response from the server.

```ts filename=greet.ts nonumber nocopy
export async function greetByResponse(response: Response) {
	const user = await response.json()
	return greet(user.firstName)
}
```

So now, whenever we need to greet a fetched user, we can use this new function:

```ts nocopy nonumber
fetch('/api/user')
	.then(response => greetByResponse(response))
	.then(greeting => render(greeting))
```

Next, we've added a test case for the `greetByResponse()` function. Since it's marked as `async`, it will return a promise when run. We will account for that promise by making the test callback `async` and `await`'ing the result of the `greetByResponse()` function call in the test:

```ts filename=greet.test.ts highlight=1,3 nocopy nonumber
test('returns a greeting message for the given user response', async () => {
	const response = Response.json({ name: 'Patrick' })
	expect(await greetByResponse(response)).toBe('Hello, Patrick! Happy, Monday.')
})
```

All the tests are passing once we run them but there's also some assertion error printed _after_ the tests. It looks suspiciously related to `greetByResponse()`.

```txt lines=2,5 nonumber nocopy
‚úì returns a greeting message for the given name
‚úì returns a greeting message for the given user response
‚úì returns a congratulation message for the given name

Error: Expected Hello, undefined! Happy, Monday. to equal to Hello, Patrick! Happy, Monday.
```

The issue here is that the `test()` function doesn't wait for the test to finish (in our case, for the `greetByResponse()` function to finish reading the user response body as JSON) so it prints a successful run even if the test fails!

üê® Your task for this exercise is to adjust the `test()` function to support the `callback()` being asynchronous and have the newly added test pass.
