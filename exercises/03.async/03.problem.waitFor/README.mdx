# Awaiting side effects

The asynchronous nature of some behaviors may be hidden from us. For example, when using React, we can update the state in response to a user request but the actual state transition cannot be accessed in test (e.g. to be awaited). It happens as a _side effect_. The thing is, we still have the intention we want to test coupled with that incaccessible side effect, so we need to account for it somehow.

Properly handling side effects, especially those we don't own (like state transition, browser navigation), is the key to eliminating flakiness in tests. In the end, we want _reliable_ tests, and side effects is the biggest contributing factor that makes them unpredictable.

In this exercise, we are introducing a `NotificationManager`‚Äîa class responsible for displaying notifications for our users. It relies on the `greetByResponse()` function we wrote earlier but doesn't expose any promises for us to await in tests.

<CodeFile file="greet.ts" range="20-32" highlight="21,28" />

> To keep this exercise simple, I will replace the actual interaction with DOM with a different side effect: pushing items to the `this.notifications` array. The strategy of dealing with side effect remains the same no matter the type of the side effect we have.

We can follow our hunch and write a test like this:

<CodeFile file="greet.test.ts" range="39-44" />

Only this won't work at all. Since reading the user response is _asynchronous_, it won't finish by the time we reach the `expect()` line. The notification simply won't be present in the array yet.

What we need is to _wait for notification_ but the `NotificationManager` class doesn't give us any means to do that directly. The only thing it gives us is the current state of the `notifications` array.

In such situations, we have to await the next state of the data we have because the updates to it are asynchronous. We can use a `waitFor` function:

```js
await waitFor(() => {
	expect(manager.notifications[0]).toBe('Hello, Kate! Happy, Monday.')
})
```

The intention behind the `waitFor` function is the following:

- Accept a callback as an argument;
- Execute the callback.
  - If the callback doesn't throw, return.
  - If the callback throws, re-run it after an interval (e.g. 250ms);
  - Retry the callback `N` times (e.g. 5). If it still throws, the `waitFor` function must forward that error to the test (throw it).

üê® That `waitFor` function sure sounds handy but where does it come from? You guessed it‚Äîyou will be implementing it yourself right now!
