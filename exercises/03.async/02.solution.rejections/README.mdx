# Promise Rejections

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/testing-fundamentals/testing-asynchronous-code/error-assertions-for-rejected-promises/solution" />

The first thing to realize is that with the `.rejects.toThrow()` API we are creating _a chain_. The `rejects` part becomes a property that returns another object with the `.toThrow()` function. I reflect this in the `Assertions` type straight away:

<CodeFile file="setup.ts" range="1-6" highlight="3-5" />

> Note that the `.rejects.toThrow()` assertion will be returning a Promise. Annotate its return type accordingly (`Promise<void>`).

Next, I extend the object returned from the `globalThis.expect` function to have the `rejects` property. In that property, I define a new `toThrow` function.

<CodeFile file="setup.ts" range="15-23" highlight="22-23" />

Although the `actual` value will be a Promise in our case, we can pass _anything_ to the `expect()` function. If we assume it's a Promise, and write `actual.catch()`, TypeScript will kindly warn us that `actual` is `unknown`, and it doesn't necessarily have the `.then()`/`.catch()` methods a Promise has.

I make sure that the passed `actual` value is the instance of Promise:

<CodeFile file="setup.ts" range="22-26" highlight="24-26" />

Now that we are always asserting on a Promise, I will make sure it rejects, and compare the expected and the actual error messages once it does.

```ts nonumber lines=7-11
rejects: {
  toThrow(expected) {
    if (!(actual instanceof Promise)) {
			throw new Error(`Expected ${actual} to be a promise`)
		}

    return actual.catch((error) => {
      if (error.message !== expected.message) {
        throw new Error(`Expected error message to be ${error.message} but got ${expected}`)
      }
    })
  }
}
```

<callout-warning>In the video, I made a mistake at 02:00! The handling of false-positive scenarios must be done via `.then(onFulfilled, onRejected)` callback, not via the `.then().catch()` chaining. See the correct implementation below, and feel free to skip to 02:28 to watch the rest of the solution.</callout-warning>

To handle the unwanted cases when the `actual` promise resolves, I will replace the `.catch()` callback with a single `.then()` callback, providing it with two arguments:

```ts remove=1 add=2
return actual.catch(onRejected)
return actual.then(onFulfilled, onRejected)
```

The `onFulfilled` function will be executed when the `actual` promise resolves, and I will throw an error if that happens. The `onRejected` function will be the same we've provided to the `.catch()` method before.

<CodeFile file="setup.ts" range="22-40" highlight="29-31" />

> Using a single `.then()` callback allow me to handle the promise fulfillment/rejection _without introducing a chain_. You can learn more about why this is important in [this issue](https://github.com/epicweb-dev/testing-fundamentals/issues/17).

Finally, I change the test case to use the newly created `.rejects.toThrow()` assertion and provide the expected error:

<CodeFile file="greet.test.ts" range="24-28" highlight="25-27" />

<callout-info>Notice that we have to `await` the `expect()` call because the `.toThrow()` function returns a promise.</callout-info>

And I verify that the newly introduced behavior of the `greetByResponse()` function behaves as intended by running the tests:

```sh
npx tsx --import ./setup.ts greet.test.ts
```

```txt nonumber nocopy
✓ returns a greeting message for the given name
✓ returns a congratulation message for the given name
✓ throws on greeting user with undefined user response
✓ returns a greeting message for the given user response
```
