# Awaiting Async Tests

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/testing-fundamentals/testing-asynchronous-code/handling-promises-in-tests/solution" />

I will start by making the `test()` function in `setup.ts` asynchronous.

<CodeFile file="setup.ts" range="22" highlight="22" />

This will allow me to await the `callback()` if it happens to be `async` too.

<CodeFile file="setup.ts" range="22-26" highlight="24" />

If I run the tests now, I can correctly see the assertion on `greetByResponse()` failing the relevant test:

```txt nocopy nonumber lines=3-4
✓ returns a greeting message for the given name
✓ returns a congratulation message for the given name
✗ returns a greeting message for the given user response
Error: Expected Hello, undefined! Happy, Monday. to equal to Hello, Patrick! Happy, Monday.
```

The rejected assertion message mentions `undefined` instead of the user's first name. If I take a look at the mocked response, it has the `{ name: string }` structure while the `greetByResponse()` function expects the response shape to be `{ firstName: string }`. The keys for the first name don't match! But who's right here—the test or the tested code?

In the previous exercises, you've learned that you should always treat test assertions as the source of truth. In this case, however, the assertion itself has nothing to do with the actual problem:

```ts filename=greet.test.ts nocopy nonumber highlight=3
test('returns a greeting message for the given user response', async () => {
	const response = Response.json({ name: 'Patrick' })
	expect(await greetByResponse(response)).toBe('Hello, Patrick! Happy, Monday.')
})
```

Instead, the root of the problem is in how we've constructed the mocked response in the test. I will resolve the issue by making sure that the mocked response I've prepared matched in shape to the one expected by the `greetByResponse()` function.

```ts filename=greet.test.ts nocopy remove=2 add=3
test('returns a greeting message for the given user response', async () => {
	const response = Response.json({ name: 'Patrick' })
	const response = Response.json({ firstName: 'Patrick' })
	expect(await greetByResponse(response)).toBe('Hello, Patrick! Happy, Monday.')
})
```

With the fix in place, I re-run the tests to see them all pass:

```sh nonumber
npx tsx --import ./setup.ts greet.test.ts
```

```txt nocopy nonumber
✓ returns a greeting message for the given name
✓ returns a congratulation message for the given name
✓ returns a greeting message for the given user response
```
