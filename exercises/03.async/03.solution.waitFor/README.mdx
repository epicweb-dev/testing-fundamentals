# Awaiting Side Effects

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/testing-fundamentals/testing-asynchronous-code/testing-with-async-side-effects/solution" />

I implement the `waitFor` function as a `while` loop, taking advantage of the `async` prefix, which means the function always returns a promise even if I don't explicitly say so. That way, I can utilize `return` to fulfill that promise, and `throw` to reject it at any point of execution.

```ts filename=greet.test.ts highlight=9,12 nonumber
async function waitFor(callback: () => void) {
	let retries = 0
	const maxRetries = 5

	while (retries < maxRetries) {
		try {
			retries++
			callback()
			return
		} catch (error) {
			if (retries === maxRetries) {
				throw error
			}

			await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 250))
		}
	}
}
```

> There are countless ways to implement the `waitFor` function. It's okay if your implementation is different from mine. As long as the intention behind it is fulfilled, it's correct (hey, doesn't that sound oddly familiar?)

Next, I wrap the notification message assertion from our test in the `waitFor` block and make sure to `await` it:

```ts filename=greet.test.ts highlight=5-7 nonumber
test('displays a notification when a new user joins', async () => {
	const manager = new NotificationManager()
	manager.showNotification(Response.json({ firstName: 'Kate' }))

	await waitFor(() => {
		expect(manager.notifications[0]).toBe('Hello, Kate! Happy, Monday.')
	})
})
```

## `waitFor` vs `sleep`

You may be wondering:

> Why can't I just pause the test and continue when all the side effects are done?

It may be extremely tempting to resort to something like a `sleep` function:

```ts lines=6
function sleep(duration: number) {
	return new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, duration))
}

test('...', async () => {
	await sleep(500)
	expect(manager.notifications[0]).toBe('...')
})
```

It's even less code, so it must be clever, right? And it does pass the test! But you see, the `sleep` function, just as it often happens with clever code, is tricker than it seems.

Identically to `waitFor`, `sleep` is detached from the side effect we want to handle (pushing to array) but there is one key difference between them:

<callout-info class="important">
	`waitFor` is waiting for the _state_, `sleep` is waiting for _time_.
</callout-info>

As engineers writing reliable tests, our foremost duty is **abandon the guesswork**. We don't know how long certain side effects will take. But when using `sleep`, we pretend like we do. This kind of confidence is a sure recipe for false positive and flaky tests. **Never `sleep` while testing!**

<callout-success>
	Make sure to always wait for state with functions like `waitFor`. It's a
	declarative way to express an expectation and help you handle things outside
	of your control.
